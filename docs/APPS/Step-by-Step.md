Simply navigate to the Testsuite interface, select "Add Test," and input the necessary details such as the test name, description, and parameters. Define the specific test steps or actions, then save the test. Once added, running the test is equally straightforward. Choose the desired test case, click on "Run Test," and, if needed, configure any specific settings. The test is then executed, providing real-time feedback on its success or failure status. This seamless workflow allows for the effortless integration of new tests into the Testsuite and ensures efficient and responsive testing of your Projectlication.
