# Merge Tests Flows


The Merging Tests API streamlines the process of integrating updates from an original script into a new script structure. This ensures that all relevant modifications are accurately reflected while maintaining compatibility with the required format.

**Inputs:**

- Original Script File: The base test script serving as the starting point.
- Modified Script File: An updated version of the original script containing changes or improvements.
- New Test JSON: JSON data representing a new test script, into which applicable changes from the original and modified scripts will be incorporated.

**Output:**

- Merged Script: A fully integrated test script, generated based on the provided JSON data, with relevant updates from the modified script seamlessly applied.


This API ensures that test scripts remain consistent, up-to-date, and aligned with the latest modifications, all while preserving compatibility and structure.
