# Testsuite

A testsuite is a collection of test cases that are designed to test the functionality of a software system or application. We create a testsuite to get all our tests there so we can run them easily. By creating a testsuite, we centralize our tests, enabling efficient and straightforward execution, contributing to a more organized and comprehensive testing approach.

Upon clicking on the testsuite, you will gain visibility into all the tests you have added and intend to run. This interface provides a comprehensive overview, allowing you to manage and initiate the execution of multiple tests within a unified and organized environment.

In this interface, you will encounter two buttons that afford you control and manipulation options. These buttons provide functionality for managing and controlling the tests within the testsuite, allowing for seamless customization and execution according to your testing requirements.

 These buttons collectively empower users to manage and optimize their testsuite dynamically. "Edit Test" ensures adaptability of individual tests, while "Add File" enhances the suite's capabilities by incorporating additional resources for more comprehensive and nuanced testing scenarios.

 ### How to run a testsuite/test?

 Running a testsuite is a straightforward processâ€”simply navigate to the designated section and click the corresponding button to initiate the execution. This streamlined approach ensures ease of use, allowing users to efficiently run their entire suite of tests with a single click, facilitating comprehensive testing of the software system or application.

Once the modal is open, you have the flexibility to select and choose specific tests that you want to run. This feature allows for targeted and customized test execution, enabling users to focus on specific scenarios or functionalities within their testsuite. This level of granularity enhances the efficiency and precision of the testing process, ensuring that only relevant tests are executed based on the current testing objectives.

### How to schedule a test?

Additionally, users have the option to schedule the execution of a testsuite for a later time. This feature allows for automated and pre-planned test runs, providing flexibility and convenience in managing testing processes within the Wring platform. By scheduling a testsuite, users can optimize testing workflows and ensure timely and systematic execution of their test scenarios.
