# Wringr - Data Driven Tests

Wringr is a versatile and powerful platform that enables organizations to easily create and run data-driven tests. With its extensive range of features and capabilities, Wringr allows organizations to conduct tests with precision and accuracy, ensuring more reliable results.

The combination of a feature file along with code allows software to be more easily tested by non-technical users.

### 1. Example of a Generated Feature File
Here is an example of a BDD (Behavior Driven Development) feature file generated by Wringr for automated testing with Playwright and Cucumber:
```
Feature: Playwright site
Scenario Outline: Session
Given I navigate to the page "https:\/\/www.google.com" 
When I enter "<value_2>" into the element "textarea[title='Search']; [role='combobox']; textarea[name='q']; textarea[id='APjFqb']; [aria-label='Search']; xpath=//textarea[contains(@role, 'combobox')]; xpath=//textarea[@title='Search']; xpath=//textarea[@id='APjFqb']; xpath=//textarea[@name='q']; xpath=//textarea[@aria-label='Search']; xpath=None; xpath=/html/body[1]/div[1]/div[3]/form[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/textarea[1]"
When I click on the element "text='SAP'" "text='SAP'; xpath=//em[contains(text(), 'SAP')]; xpath=None; xpath=/html/body[1]/div[5]/div[1]/div[13]/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/span[1]/em[1]"
Then I should see the text "<value_to_verify>"
Examples:
| value_2   | value_to_verify   |
| Sap23\n     | Sap               |
|  sap24\n    | Sap               |
|  sap25\n    | Sap               |
```

### Scenario Outline
This defines a template for testing different inputs and expected outcomes.

- **Given**: Specifies the starting point, in this case, navigating to Google's homepage.
- **When**: Describes the actions to be performed, such as entering text into the search bar and clicking on a search result.
- **Then**: Verifies the expected outcome, ensuring that the correct text is displayed.
- **Examples Table**: Lists different sets of inputs and expected results to be tested.

Using Wringr, you can generate similar feature files to automate your testing process, ensuring thorough and accurate validation of your application's functionality.

### Viewing Feature Details in the Cucumber File

If you check the features in the Cucumber file, you will see detailed steps and scenarios. Here’s what you can expect to find:

#### Feature Definition
At the top of the file, you will see the feature name, such as **"Playwright site"**.

#### Scenario Outline
The scenario outline defines the template for the tests. For example:
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Session
Given I navigate to the page "https://www.google.com" 
```
#### Step Definitions
Detailed steps for the scenario are provided. Each step includes actions like clicking on elements, entering text, and verifying results. For example:
```gherkin
When I click on the element "textarea[title='Search']"
When I enter "sap" into the element "textarea[title='Search']"
```
#### Example Table
The example table lists different sets of inputs and expected results for the tests. For example:
```gherkin
Examples:
| value_8                            | value_11 | value_to_verify |
| Sap software solutions             | Sap      | Sap             |
| business applications and technology | Sap    | <value_11>      |
```
By checking the Cucumber file, you can see all the details about the feature, including the steps and the data used for testing. This comprehensive view helps you understand how the tests are structured and what they aim to verify.

After running `npm install` and `npm test` in the terminal, follow these steps to review your test results:

### Review Test Steps
- The test results will display a list of all the actions performed during the test.
- Each action, such as navigating to a page, entering text, or clicking an element, will be shown with detailed information.

### Check Test Status
- Each step will have a status indicator:
  - A green checkmark (✔) means the step passed.
  - A red cross (✖) means the step failed.

### View Additional Resources
- You can view additional resources such as screenshots, videos, and traces to further investigate any issues:
  - **screenshot**: Provides a snapshot of the application at the point of failure.
  - **video**: Offers a video recording of the entire test session.
  - **Download trace**: Allows you to download a detailed trace of the test execution for further analysis.

### Examples Table
- At the bottom, you will see an examples table that shows different sets of input values and expected results.
- Each row in the table will indicate whether the test passed or failed for those specific values.
