# Sessions

### How to use sessions?

Projects offer a straightforward and user-friendly experience. Simply launch your preferred browser, be it Google, Microsoft Edge, Opera, or any other, and navigate to the desired page you wish to record. Our system will capture your actions as you traverse the site, encompassing interactions such as clicks on menus, buttons, links, and any other elements you engage with. Concluding the recording process is as simple as exiting the page or pressing the designated stop button. This seamless projectroach ensures ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly record and analyze their interactions within the web environment.

Wring comprehensively captures every user action during the execution of a test. Within the Wring project, users can access a detailed log of all steps performed, providing a comprehensive overview of the testing process. This includes information such as the duration of the test, the specific browser utilized, and the geographical location at the time of test creation. Wring's capability to record these intricacies ensures transparency and detailed insights into the testing environment, empowering users with a thorough understanding of the testing workflow and conditions.
