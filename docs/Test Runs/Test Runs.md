# Test Runs Overview

 Test Runs represent a record or log of the various instances in which you executed a set of tests. The "test runs" section provides a comprehensive overview of all the runs you have conducted, allowing you to review and analyze the results of each test execution. This feature facilitates tracking the history of your testing activities, providing insights into the performance, success, or any encountered issues during different testing sessions. It serves as a valuable tool for test management and quality assurance, enabling you to monitor the progress and outcomes of your testing efforts over time.

In this section, you have visibility into a comprehensive log of various types of test runs, encompassing your own test runs, shared runs, API runs, as well as runs executed on external platforms like Sauce Labs and AWS. This consolidated view offers a centralized and organized way to review and manage different categories of test executions, providing a holistic perspective on your testing activities across diverse environments and scenarios.

The ability to add tests manually provides a versatile approach to test management within the platform. This feature allows users to input and define tests directly, supplementing automated test executions. Click `Add Test` button to add a test.

To access and view runs from external integrations such as Sauce Labs or AWS, you need to add these integrations in the "Connect" tab. This enables seamless communication and data exchange between the Wring platform and these external services. Once integrated, you'll have a consolidated view of all your test runs, including those executed on external platforms, providing a unified and comprehensive overview of your testing activities.
