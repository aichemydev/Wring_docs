### How to use Pageviews?

Pageviews are simple and easy to use. All you have to do is go to a browser (Google, Microsoft Edge, Opera...etc) and open the page you want to record. We will record your actions as you navigate around the site, including clicks on menus, buttons, links and anything else that you interact with. When you're done recording the page just exit or press the stop button

Wring captures all the steps taken by the user while running a Test. You can view everything you did in the Wring app, including how long it took, which browser you were using and where in the world you were when you created that test.

Every time you click, we'll pick up where you left off. We'll show you every step of your run in real time, plus a visual representation of the steps taken.                                                                
After clicking on your run, you'll see your stats. We track every step you've taken so far, and then show you a video of every step you took during the run.

It’s like having a second monitor for your mouse. It will record every move you do on your screen – whether it be drawing, highlighting or simply moving files around.                                                       
This tool will remember every mouse move that you make and draw them red. It makes debugging much easier!
