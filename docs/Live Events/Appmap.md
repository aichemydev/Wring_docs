## Key Flows

Key flows is a tool that allows to find the best test coverage among all tests generated from live events. By default, it groups tests that cover at least 20% of the most frequent webpage elements. Rel Cov % means relative coverage percentage and it shows the coverage of a test against other tests in the list.

It uses a greedy algorithm and allows you to create a list that covers all tests, as well as generate several other metrics such as Rel Cov %.

To run a key flows, you have to go to the dropdown at the top right and select one of the key flows.
