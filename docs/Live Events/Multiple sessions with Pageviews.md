# Multiple Sessions with Pageviews

Live Events allows you to record and analyze user actions on your website, enabling you to understand each action in a testcase. You can then generate test cases based on the steps you did.

This can then be used to see how different users navigate a website and where they interact with the site. Live Events also gives you the option of recording multiple sessions so you can gain multiple generated testcases by only checking a website/application more than once.
By recording the same page over and over again, we will generate multiple sessions.

 ### How to know if you did multiple sessions?

When you first go to the test in Wring platform, you will see multiple video clips in one.
