### Pageviews

Live Events or as we call it - "Pageviews" is a tool that allows you to record user actions on a website and generate a test case from these actions. Also, with Pageviews, you can see most common paths how users moves from one webpage to another that allows to improve website usability and to find and fix critical bugs.

Live Events allows you to capture user actions on your website and generate a test case from these actions, including the mouse coordinates and keystrokes. You can even start a recording from a real device you are using (iPhone, iPad or Android). 

#### How to use Pageviews?

It's easy, all you have to do is go to a browser (Google, Microsoft Edge, Opera...etc) and open the page you want to record. 
Like this:

Wring captures all the steps taken by the user while running a Test. You can view everything you did in the Wring app, including how long it took, which browser you were using and where in the world you were when you created that test.
