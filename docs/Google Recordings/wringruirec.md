# **Integrating and Uploading Tests in Wringr UI**

### Integrating and Uploading Tests in Wringr UI

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to integrate and upload recorded tests into the Wringr UI. Leveraging the power of the Chrome DevTools Recorder, users can capture detailed UI interactions and seamlessly add them to the Wringr platform for in-depth analysis, debugging, and validation. This process ensures efficient test management and enhances the overall quality assurance workflow.

Once you have exported the JSON file, simply navigate to the Wringr UI. From there, you can upload the JSON file, allowing you to analyze, debug, and validate the recorded test steps within the platform. 

1. Go to Projects and choose a project
