# Create a Testsuite

Wring allows you to have test suites with multiple tests on them. Test suites can be run with completion of the entire suite or simply one different test.

`Add Test` Modal allows you to upload multiple tests in one go. You could also add multiple tests manually, like this: 

![Test Explorer](/img/testsuite.png)

Once TestSuite is run, you should see a progress bar indicating the status of each test. When all tests are finished, TestSuite will show that everything went well (paased or failed). You have to wait the exact time the tests you added to be finished.
TestSuite will look like this:

Once the TestSuite is finished, you'll be presented with a single page that has your tests on it.

On Suite Overview, you will see: *test status, run time, failures, suggestions, auto healed and time saved*
Also a diagram on how your tests looked before Wring and how are they now - After Wring.

On All Tests, you will see all tests that you run on TestSuite listed there. You can check each test separately and see it as a regular test.

You can easily manipulate tests, starting to edit, rerun or even delete it.
