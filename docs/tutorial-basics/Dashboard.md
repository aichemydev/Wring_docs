# Dashboard

Welcome to the Dashboard!

The Dashboard provides a quick overview of your tests, including key metrics like test cases and assertions, run time and execution cost. The higher you move up the ranks, the more detailed the statistics become. You can also see the error rate by test or individual test case. There is also a screenshot of your current test run as itâ€™s executing in browser.
