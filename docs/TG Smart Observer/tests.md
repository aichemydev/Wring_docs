The most important feature of `Wring Smart Observer` is that it allows you to change the `command`, `target` and `value` of your testcase by just simple typing.

The recorder also allows you to select your own element.

You will also see the mini-recorder, it has the same functionality as the big recorder. It shows the steps that we are recording for the moment. Also we can control the recording from the buttons - `Go to big recorder`, ` Play | Stop recording`, and `Send test`.

Details: 

1. **Go to big recorder** - *allows you to switch from mini-recorder to big recorder.*
2. **Play | Stop recording** - *Start and end recording.*
3. **Send test** - *send test from mini-recorder to browser.*
4. **Logo** - *Wring logo in mini-recorder.*
5. **Minus** - *minimaze the mini-recorder.*
6. **Maximaze/Minimaze** - *maximaze and minimaze the mini-recorder.*

When you start clicking on some particular place on the `url` `(Website)` you wanted, it will automatically generate the steps and list them on big recorder and in mini-recorder as well. Designed with a dedicated recording button (pause/stop), so that you can easily pause or stop your recording without missing any detail of your analysis.

Once you've finished testing, just click the `Close` button on the Chrome tab, then hit `Stop recording` and go to the Send test button.

Then you will get a notification that your test is already sent.
