# Start recording

To start recording, first you need to go to `New Test` - Check below:

After you go to `New Test`, it will open a modal page for you to write the name you wanted for your own test.

It will send you directly to the page for starting a test.

Go and press `Rec` button to start your test. It will send you directly to `Google` - where you can write your wanted `url` to test.

Also, our recorder allows you to change the `command`, `target` and `value` too.

The recorder also allows you to select your own element.

You will also see the mini-recorder, it has the same functionality as the big recorder. It shows the steps that we are recording for the moment. Also we can control the recording from the buttons - `Go to big recorder`, ` Play | Stop recording`, and `Send test`.

Details: 

1. **Go to big recorder** - *allows you to switch from mini-recorder to big recorder.*
2. **Play | Stop recording** - *Start and end recording.*
3. **Send test** - *send test from mini-recorder to browser.*
4. **Logo** - *Wring logo in mini-recorder.*

6. **Maximaze/Minimaze** - *maximaze and minimaze the mini-recorder.*

When you start clicking on some particular place on the `url` `(Website)` you wanted, it will automatically generate the steps and list them on big recorder and in mini-recorder as well.
