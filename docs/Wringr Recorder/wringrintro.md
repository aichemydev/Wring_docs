# Get Started with Wringr Recorder 

We will send you a zip file containing all the Wringr Recorder content. To start using it, follow these steps:

**Extract the Zip File:**

Right-click on the downloaded zip file and select "Extract All..." from the context menu.

**Locate the Extracted Folder:**

Once the extraction is complete, open the uncompressed folder. It contains all the necessary files for the Wringr Recorder.

Make sure you always extract the zip file before attempting to use the recorder, as running it directly from the zip may cause errors or limit functionality.
