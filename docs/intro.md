# Getting Started

Let's discover **Wring's Key Features**.

## Key Concepts

Wring is a test automation solution that uses deep learning to auto heal your tests. Rapid feature addition and infrastructure changes are two things that can cause your robust regression tests to gradually degrade into unviable failures. With Wrings proprietary machine learning algorithms, we help you keep your tests healthy and up-to-date in order to support new features quickly and efficiently.

Wrings ability to self-heal test decay makes it easier for your team to increase coverage, automate critical features, and release code quickly and safely. With Wring, you save time, money, and resources while ensuring your testing coverage is always up to date. Once youâ€™ve written the script, Wring will auto-run your tests on a schedule, or even continuously in real time.

The Wring platform is designed for coders who have an established development process but are interested in AI driven healing, stability, and easy test augmentation. It will reduce costs and risks by easily ensuring the health and auto-maintenance of your tests. Wring is the only automation solution of its kind that auto-completes your tests.


Wring can be up and running in your environment in less than 10 minutes without the need for new test languages or framework
