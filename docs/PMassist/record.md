# PM Assist - Start recording

Before we start recording a website, you have to know that this extension is linked with Live events (for more information about Live Events, please go to Live Events section). 

You have to create a project on Live Events tab and then start recording, so each session you record will be shown there. 

If you are looking for a way to record your website with PM Assist, it is easy. We will show you how to do it step by step in our guide.

Once you go to your (chosen/wanted) website, open PM Assist (check `PM Assist - Ready to start!` on how to open it) and click on `Record/Observe` button. Then, click on what steps you want to record.

After you run a test and make sure everything works as it should, go to your project on the Live Events tab. You’ll see a new test or session that wasn’t there before.

In Live Events tab, you will see a video on all the steps you did, run and download (*download the file later and use it as reference information during any future testing.*) the testcase you just did (.wring file) and more.
